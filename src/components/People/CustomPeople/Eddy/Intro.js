            Ever since that day we first met in the app, I‚Äôve always wanted to

            Some things are hard to say out loud (or at least, when we chat) but
            thank you for making it so much easier, and for making me a little
            bit more fearless. I really enjoy talking to you and I like what I‚Äôm

            The feeling of seeing you for the very first time is{" "}

              always the first thing I remember

            when I look back on the first time we were at Wildflour. I never
            knew that simple and first Friday together would be so special. I‚Äôll
            never forget that moment when I walked through the doors and we saw
            each other{" "}
            <ImageContainer index={7}>for the very first time</ImageContainer>.
            Not sure if you‚Äôve had one of those moments, but for me, a specific
            song definitely played in my head as soon as I walked in. I don‚Äôt
            know if you remember also, but I said ‚ÄúI suck with topics and
            convos‚Äù and I apologized soon after. But there you were to assure me
            that everything‚Äôs fine, and that we were doing okay. What I didn‚Äôt
            tell you was I was so worried about{" "}
            <ImageContainer index={9}>messing it all up</ImageContainer>, and
            that I can‚Äôt believe that we‚Äôre finally there, together. Those
            thoughts made my mind stop for some time, and lucky that you were
            always there to <span className="is-italic">‚Äúsalo‚Äù</span> the convo.
            Even if I had strict parents to work our schedules around to, it
            didn‚Äôt seem to bother you. And all I could think of at that moment
            was that I wanted to{" "}
            <ImageContainer index={6}>spend more time with you</ImageContainer>.
            Nevertheless, it was{" "}

              a Friday I will always cherish

            There were times in the middle of our convos, where I‚Äôd think that

            every time we‚Äôd talk, I would always wonder if there would be{" "}
